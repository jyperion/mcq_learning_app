When gradients are backpropagated through time in RNNs or LSTMs and become very large, they can cause the weights to update excessively, leading to unstable training and potentially blowing the gradients out of bounds. This can result in vanishing gradients for earlier time steps, making it harder for the model to learn from those steps."
