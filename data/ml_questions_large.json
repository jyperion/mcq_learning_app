    "explanation": "Statistical significance in A/B testing indicates that there is a notable difference in model performance between two versions (A and B) that cannot be attributed to random variation. This is often determined using hypothesis tests such as the t-test, where p-values below a threshold (e.g., 0.05) suggest significant differences. The formula for calculating the t-statistic is: \\[ t = \\frac{\\bar{X}_A - \\bar{X}_B}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_A^2}{n_A} +",
